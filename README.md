# 4-Bit Binary Adder with BCD Decoder VHDL Implementation

This repository contains VHDL code for a 4-bit binary adder with a BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) decoder. The binary adder computes the sum of two 4-bit binary numbers using full adders, and the result is displayed on a 7-segment display through the BCD decoder.

## Contents

- `bcd_decoder.vhd`: VHDL code for the BCD to 7-segment decoder.
- `half_adder.vhd`: VHDL code for the half adder component.
- `full_adder.vhd`: VHDL code for the full adder component.
- `main.vhd`: VHDL code for the main module that instantiates the binary adder and BCD decoder.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Usage

To use this VHDL implementation of the 4-bit binary adder with BCD decoder, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a VHDL development environment set up, such as Quartus Prime Lite Edition.
2. Open the VHDL files in your development environment.
3. Simulate the design to verify its functionality.
4. Modify the VHDL code as needed to suit your specific requirements.
5. Synthesize the design for your target FPGA device.
